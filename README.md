# WebScreenshotAutomation
This is the code that I created to automate a part of my research process which includes taking screenshots of the website cookies. 
You can add the list of websites that you would like to take a screenshot of and the program will do that. The code can also be modified to look for 
specific elements based on their HTML IDs to take more specialized screenshots.
